09.Problem: Left and Right sum
Write a program that reads 2 * n-th number of integers supplied by the user and checks whether the sum of the first n numbers (left sum) is equal 
to the sum of the second n numbers (right sum). If there is a tie, print "Yes, sum = " + the sum; otherwise it prints "No, diff = " + the difference. 
The difference is calculated as a positive number (in absolute value).

• If the sums are equal, print two lines: "Yes" and on a new line "Sum = " + the sum;
• If the sums are not equal, print two lines: "No" and on a new line "Diff = " + the difference.
The difference is calculated in absolute value.
